    "text": "Abstract\nHankkeessa tutkittiin verkkovihan tuottajia ja levittäjiä määrällisesti (verkostoanalyysi, some-aineiston luokittelu) ja laadullisesti (teemat ja retoriikka). Heidän toimintatapojaan ja motiivejaan tarkasteltiin teemahaastatteluin, internet-etnografialla ja verkkokyselyllä. Tietoa tuotettiin myös rangaistavan vihapuheen tekijöistä ja heidän verkostoistaan. Viestinnän sisällön, toimintatapojen ja tapahtumapaikkojen tarkastelun perusteella tuottajat ja levittäjät luokiteltiin ideologisesti, affektiivisesti ja performatiivisesti motivoituneisiin vihapuhujiin. Limittäisillä ryhmillä on eri päämääriä ja viestit kohdistetaan eri yleisöille. Verkkovihaa tuotetaan sekä organisoidusti että spontaanisti.Organisoituneita tuottajia on vähän. Yleisö kierrättää viestejä moninkertaistaen niiden näkyvyyden. Anonyymeja tunnuksia luodaan kertakäyttöä varten.Viharikosten määrä on laskenut ja vihapuherikosten määrä kasvanut. Suurin osarangaistavasta vihapuheesta on yksittäisten henkilöiden tekemää. Pieni osa onkeskenään verkostoituneita äärioikeistolaisessa liikehdinnässä toimivia avainhenkilöitä.Vihapuheen kitkemiseen ehdotamme toimenpiteiksi tutkimustiedon tuottamista,verkkovihan tuottajien ja levittäjien tukimuotoja, tietoisuuden lisäämistä verkkovihan levittämisestä, verkkokeskustelujen seurantaa, some-alustojen vastuunkantoa, poliisin lisäresursseja ja vuoropuhelun edistämistä.Julkaisu on läpikäynyt ulkopuolisen tieteellisen arvioinnin."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nUsing survey data from 154,195 respondents in 142 countries, we investigate internet user perceptions of the risks associated with being exposed to misinformation. We find that: 1) The majority of regular internet users globally (58.5%) worry about misinformation, and young and low-income groups are most likely to be concerned. 2) Risk perception among internet users varies starkly across regions whereby concern is highest in Latin America and the Caribbean (74.2%), and lowest in South Asia (31.2%). 3) Differences are unrelated to the prevalence of misinformation, yet concern is highest in countries with liberal democratic governments. We discuss implications for successful policy and platform interventions."

It describes 8,122 videos that were shared between November 2019 and June 2020. The dataset contains unique identifiers for the videos and social media accounts that shared the videos, statistics on social media engagement and metadata such as video titles and view counts where they were recoverable. The dataset has reuse potential for research studying narratives related to the coronavirus, the impact of social media on knowledge about health and the politics of social media platforms."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nInternet disinformation, fraud and harassment have emerged as global concerns. While governments, industry, and civil society groups around the world struggle to address these concerns, there is little comparative data on public perception of the risks associated with using social media and the internet. In this memo, we analyze survey data of 154,195 participants living in 142 countries. On average, people rarely identify technology-related risks as the most prominent threats to their quality of life. But they feature prominently for a significant proportion of the global population and, naturally, feature very prominently for respondents who regularly use social media and the internet. First, we find that globally, disinformation is the single most important fear of internet and social media use and more than half (53%) of regular internet users are concerned about disinformation. Second, almost three quarters (71%) of internet users are worried about a mixture of threats, including online disinformation, fraud and harassment. Third, there is interesting variation in how concerned people are with particular internet harms: worry about the impact of disinformation is highest in North America and Europe, and lowest in East and South Asia; concern about online harassment is higher among women, and especially so among women in Latin America."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nContemporary communication requires both a supply of content and a digital information infrastructure. Modern campaigns of misinformation are especially dependent on that back-end infrastructure for tracking and targeting a sympathetic audience and generating revenue that can sustain the campaign financially—if not enable profiteering. However, little is known about the political economy of misinformation, particularly those campaigns spreading misleading or harmful content about public health guidelines and vaccination programs. To understand the political economy of health misinformation, we analyze the content and infrastructure networks of 59 groups involved in communicating misinformation about vaccination programs. With a unique collection of tracker and communication infrastructure data, we demonstrate how the political economy of misinformation depends on platform monetization infrastructures. We offer a theory of communication resource mobilization that advances understanding of the communicative context, organizational interactions, and political outcomes of misinformation production."

    "section": "How it works",
    "text": "How it works\nWe connected the photographs from Streetview with data from the Indices of Multiple Deprivation, describing levels of income, education and environmental health across the city. The resulting GAN model generates novel, synthetic images of housing that can be manipulated according to these contextual variables.\nBy pulling on the sliders next to images, you can compare the visual differences between privileged or deprived areas of the capital. It is a way to visualise an abstract social process, inequality in the city, that would otherwise be difficult to see.\nA technical paper describing the project will be available later.\nThis inequality doesn’t exist is an experiment in trying out how models such as GANs can be used to produce knowledge. Latent space walks suggest a speculative configuration for knowledge production that relies on synthetic data and retains a role of interpretation by human participants. This process demonstrates the variety of uses that mathematical concepts and technical systems such as the latent spaces of generative models can be put to."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nTo date, there is little research to measure the scale of misinformation and understand how it spreads on largely unmoderated platforms. Our analysis of 200,000 Telegram posts demonstrates that links to known sources of misleading information are shared more often than links to professional news content, but the former stays confined to relatively few channels. We conclude that, contrary to popular received wisdom, the audience for misinformation is not a general one, but a small and active community of users. Our study strengthens an empirical consensus regarding the spread of misinformation and expands it for the case of Telegram."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nValtio sekä kunnat ylläpitävät tehtäviään varten henkilötietorekistereitä, joista monet ovat sisällöltään ainutlaatuisia ja monikäyttöisiä. Joillakin hallinnonaloilla henkilöitä koskevan tiedon hyödyntämiseen liittyvät säännöt ovat sallivia, mutta henkilötiedon käyttöä rajaavat laissa määritellyt käyttötarkoitukset sekä tarvittaviin lupiin liittyvät monimutkaiset käytännöt. MyData-periaatteet kuvaavat ajatusta, että ihmisillä on määräysvaltaa heitä koskevaan tietoon. Niihin liittyy toimintamalli, jossa ihmisille tarjotaan käytännön keinoja hallita omien tietojensa käyttöä ja jakaa tietojaan eri palveluihin antamiensa lupien perusteella. Tällaiset keinot hyödyntää tietoa voisivat pienentää uusien palveluiden kehityskustannuksia ja tukea nopeiden kokeilujen tekemistä sekä yksityisellä että julkisella sektorilla. Samalla ne vahvistaisivat julkisten palveluiden ymmärrettävyyttä ja yksilöiden oikeuksia omaan tietoonsa. MyData-periaatteet voidaan toteuttaa useammalla erilaisella tavalla. Raportissa vaihtoehtoja jäsennetään luokittelulla, joka sisältää viisi eri vaatimustasoa, sekä käytännön ratkaisuilla näiden saavuttamiseen. Selvityksessä ehdotetaan, että alustoja ja työkaluja tuotettaisiin niin, että rekisterinpitäjät voisivat valita tilanteeseensa sopivat keinot tehdä henkilötieto saatavaksi. Julkishallinnon tulisi pyrkiä myös synnyttämään luottamusta ja helpottamaan yksilöiden sekä palveluntarjoajien kanssakäymistä, esimerkiksi yleisillä malleilla käyttöehdoille sekä yhteisillä ymmärrettävillä keinoilla kuvata henkilötiedon käytön tapoja. Raportissa kuvataan MyData-periaatteiden soveltamisen vaikutuksia julkishallintoon ja muihin sidosryhmiin kolmen tapaustutkimuksen kautta. Tiedon parempi saatavuus mahdollistaa yksilöityjä palveluita ja uudenlaisia sovelluksia, muun muassa ennaltaehkäisevän terveydenhuollon saralla"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe development of generative artificial intelligence sustains a proliferation of machine learning models capable of synthesizing text, images, sounds, and other kinds of content. While the increasing realism of synthetic content stokes fears about misinformation and triggers debates around intellectual property, generative models are adopted across creative industries, and synthetic media is already becoming an integral component of cultural products. Qualitative research in the social and human sciences has dedicated comparatively little attention to this category of machine learning, particularly in terms of what types of novel research methodology they both demand and facilitate. In this article, we propose a methodological approach for the qualitative study of generative models grounded on the experimentation with field devices which we call synthetic ethnography. Synthetic ethnography is not simply a qualitative research methodology applied to the study of the social and cultural contexts developing around generative models, but also strives to envision practical and experimental ways to repurpose these technologies as research tools in their own right. After briefly introducing generative models and synthetic media and revisiting the trajectory of digital ethnographic research, we discuss three case studies for which the authors have developed experimental field devices to study different generative AI ethnographically. In the conclusion, we derive a broader methodological proposal from these case studies, arguing that synthetic ethnography facilitates insights into how the algorithmic processes, training datasets and latent spaces behind these systems modulate bias, reconfigure agency, and challenge epistemological categories."
