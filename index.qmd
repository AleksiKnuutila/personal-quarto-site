I'm a senior researcher at the [Sociology department](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-social-sciences/research/disciplines-and-research-units/sociology) at the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi). I received a PhD from the Centre for Digital Anthropology at University College London in 2017.

I study how people use digital media for political purposes and to understand current events. I also develop new methods for making sense of large, openly available datasets.

I am currently working on the following topics:

- How images from conflicts are translated into evidence and are included in reporting ([project page](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/projects/eyewitness-images-and-networked-verification-in-the-war-in-ukrain))
- How meme communities focused on political theory developed new ideas ([project page](https://vastapuhe.fi))
- Mapping out European communities on unmoderated platforms such as Telegram, and building open infrastructure to facilitate their research ([project page](https://www.tuni.fi/en/research/everyday-affective-practices-online-producing-experiencing-and-managing-hate-speech))

On this site, you can find links to my publications. If you’d like to read anything here and can’t access it, please feel free to [email](aleksi.knuutila@helsinki.fi) me for a copy.
